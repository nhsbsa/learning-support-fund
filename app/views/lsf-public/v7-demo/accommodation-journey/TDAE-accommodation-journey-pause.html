          <p>You need to tell us about any journeys you have made between your term-time address and your accommodation. For each one, we need to know:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>whether you were travelling to or from your accommodation</li>
            <li>the date of your journey</li>
            <li>your method of transport</li>
            <li>the total cost of your journey</li>
          </ul>

          <p>You also need to show us evidence for your costs. For example, public transport tickets or receipts for parking charges.</p>

          <p>If you did multiple journeys, you can add these after you've told us about the first one.</p>
