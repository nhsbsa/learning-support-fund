          <p>If you took a taxi during your placement, Disabled Students' Allowance (DSA) may have reimbursed some of the costs for that.</p>

          <p>They calculate what they pay you using the actual cost of your journey minus what the public transport journey would have cost.</p>

          <p>You can claim back the public transport journey cost that DSA did not.</p>

          <p>You'll need to give us:</p>
          <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
            <li>evidence of the taxi cost</li>
            <li>your DSA2 letter with the public transport equivalent cost on</li>
          </ul>

          <p>If you used multiple taxis, you can add these after you have told us about the first one.</p>

          <button class="nhsuk-button" type="submit">Add first taxi journey</button><br>
