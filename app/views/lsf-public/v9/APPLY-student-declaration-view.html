            <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Changes to circumstances or attendance</h3>

            <p>I accept that NHSBSA Student Services will immediately stop or suspend my funding if:</p>
            <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
              <li>I withdraw, abandon, suspend, defer, or interrupt my course for any reason either permanently or temporarily, regardless of whether I intend to return</li>
              <li>I gain financial support from other sources which may affect my entitlement</li>
              <li>NHSBSA Student Services in its absolute discretion decides that I’m no longer entitled to financial support and it’s reasonable to withdraw funding</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I understand and accept that if I fail to notify NHSBSA Student Services of any change to my bank or building society account details in sufficient time, or provide incorrect information, NHSBSA Student Services cannot take responsibility for:</p>
            <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
              <li>payments made to an incorrect account</li>
              <li>delayed payments</li>
              <li>payments not being made</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Repayments</h3>

            <p>We’re committed to accurately administering entitlement where possible. I agree to pay back NHSBSA Student Services any excess payment, fees, and any other charges within 30 days of being notified. Related circumstances include, but are not limited to, if:</p>
            <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
              <li>I change my study pattern or course attendance in any way</li>
              <li>I withdraw, abandon, suspend, defer, or interrupt my course for any reason either permanently or temporarily, regardless of whether I intend to return</li>
              <li>I’ve been overpaid because I failed to notify NHSBSA Student Services of a change in my circumstances</li>
              <li>I gain financial support from other sources which may affect my entitlement</li>
              <li>NHSBSA Student Services in its absolute discretion decides I’ve received funding I’m not entitled to</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I understand that if I fail to fully repay any amount due or agree on an acceptable repayment plan with NHSBSA, the debt will pass to a debt collection agency. I also understand that I may be charged for any additional recovery costs, interest, or both, at the rate of 8% on the referred debt. This may be added to the overall balance.</p>

            <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">NHS Learning Support Fund</h3>

            <p>I understand the NHSBSA is responsible for administrating the NHS Learning Support Fund and for counter fraud and security management in the NHS.</p>

            <p>I have read and accepted the NHSBSA Student Services privacy notice.</p>

            <p>I understand if I fail to notify NHSBSA Student Services that I have withdrawn, abandoned, suspended, deferred or interrupted my course for any reason either permanently or temporarily, I may be referred to the NHSBSA Loss and Fraud Prevention Team for failure to disclose information and obtaining money I’m not entitled to.</p>
            <p>I declare the information I’ve given on this form and in any supporting documents is complete and accurate. I understand and accept that if I give NHSBSA Student Services false or misleading information, they may refuse or withdraw financial support. I may also be liable to criminal prosecution, civil proceedings, or both.</p>
