            <li>the cost you paid</li>
            <li>the date(s) you hired the vehicle</li>

            <li>the reason why you needed to hire a vehicle</li>
          </ul>

          <p>If you hired more than one vehicle, you can add another towards the end of this section.</p>

          <p>Multiple bookings for the same vehicle should be separated.</p>
