					<h2 class="nhsuk-heading-s">Calculating the extra daily cost</h2>
					<p>You need to work out:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>how many days you drove to university in the period your pass covers</li>
							<li>how many of those days are in the period you're claiming for</li>
						</ul>
					<p>Then divide the total cost of your pass by the number of eligible days for the correct daily cost.</p>
					<h3 class="nhsuk-heading-xs">For example</h3>
					<p>You bought a monthly parking pass for £20, but only drove to university on 10 days in the period you're claiming for. The extra daily cost is £2.</p>
